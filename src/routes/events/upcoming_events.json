    "description": "Hills and flat. This workout is a combination of short, high intensity  repeats coupled with either a steady or threshold effort 10 minute segments. This is a good early or mid-season workout for any athlete. The high intensity repeats helps with muscle recruitment while the 10 minute segments will have more of an aerobic benefit. First, 4x45 sec hard on hills, followed by 10 minutes around Greenlake. Then, we will do another 4x45 seconds hard around Greenlake and finish it off with another 10 minute interval. If you are in the beginning stages of a training block, it is best to do the 10 minute effort around a 7 RPE or half marathon effort. If you are in the more advanced stages of a training block, the 10 minute repeats should be done at a 8 RPE or 10k effort or a tad slower.\n\nMeetup: Lower Woodland Soccer Parking, 5000 West Green Lake Way N, Seattle, WA 98103\n\nA group will leave for a warm up at 6:30, start drills + strides at 6:50, and werkout starts at 7am.
