    "description": "“drop in for a no drop run!”\n\nnot set route, no set pace, just a common place to meet up and find company for your monday miles! start the week off right and join us at 6:00pm every first, second, and third monday of the month at the trailhead store! \n\nthis event is open to women, trans, and non-binary people who are comfortable in a space that centers the experiences of women. our only rule is that nobody runs alone :) \n\n*4th/5th monday will typically be field trip runs at outside locations announced on the cowgill strava page ",
