    "description": "NEW TIME for the Christmas day werkout! The werkout will be at Cougar Mountain and starting at 8:30 AM. This werkout will feature a good amount of runnable trail and moderate grades, which is both fun and incredibly not fun at the same time. This would is great for anyone looking to race a runnable trail race and will build both your climbing and descending legs. The werkout is .9 miles up Clay Pit road which is a wide road. After a short rest, we will head over to the Harvey Manning Trail for a loop up to Cougar Mountain to the top. After a short rest, we will head back down the West side until we get to the Harving Manning/Cougar Junction again. We will complete this loop a second time with the same rest/intensities.
