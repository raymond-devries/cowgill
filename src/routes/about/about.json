We noticed there wasn’t a trail running-focused group in Seattle, and we wanted to create a platform to connect the trail running community.  We started with a weekly Thursday morning trail run and now have four weekly runs, in addition to camping opportunities with unique routes every weekend.  \n\nWe strive to foster interactions, help runners achieve, increase trail stewardship, make the sport more inclusive and accessible, and put on unique events. Our members do not pay dues, all our events are free and open to the public, and we have a diverse range of runners, from beginner trail runners to professional athletes.",
