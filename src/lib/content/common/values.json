  "body": "# Values\n\nCowgill Trail Collective is more than a running club — it's a social system shaped by shared values and relationships. We recognize that as a social system we are susceptible to continuing biases, maintaining barriers, and participating in injust and exclusionary behaviors. We acknowledge that we are responsible for counteracting these qualities which do not serve the values and wellbeing of our community. Recognizing ourselves as more than just a running club affirms our role in shaping a community where connection, equity, and shared responsibility matter.\n\nWhat are the shared values of Cowgill?\n\n* Cultivating belonging in a diverse running community\n* Expanding access to trail running\n* Fostering interactions through regular running events\n* Helping runners achieve and grow, especially on trails\n* Stewarding the land on which we run\n* Hosting unique events across the Pacific Northwest\n\nBelonging is the feeling of being an integral and valued member of the trail running community. Belonging happens when runners not only feel welcomed but also experience a deep sense of connection, knowing their presence and contributions matter. It is the outcome of consistent efforts in diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nCowgill Trail Collective commits to taking specific actions that foster:\n\n**Diversity**: The presence of differences within the trail running community, including but not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, age, ability, socioeconomic background, and experience level. A diverse community values the unique perspectives and lived experiences that each runner brings to the trails.\n\n**Equity**: The practice of ensuring fair access, opportunities, and resources for all runners, recognizing that some individuals may need additional support to fully participate. Equity means addressing barriers—such as financial constraints, accessibility challenges, or cultural exclusions—that might prevent people from engaging in trail running.\n\n**Inclusion**: The intentional creation of an environment where all runners feel welcomed, respected, and valued. Inclusion goes beyond just inviting people in; it means actively fostering a culture where diverse voices are heard, and everyone has a sense of belonging, regardless of their background or ability.",
